                        <p>This class will focus on strengthening and toning the muscles of the pelvic floor, as well as opening the hips to prepare for childbirth. The class will be geared towards strengthening the legs to comfortably support the extra weight of the baby. It will incorporate some vinyasa flow to help circulate the blood and to remove unwanted toxins away from the body and the baby. This class will also give special attention to stretching the low back, as the weight of the belly can cause discomfort and compression of the lower lumbar during pregnancy. <a href="about/#instructors">Learn more about Ellie and Jennifer.</a></p>

                        <p>Mondays 8:15pm - 9:30pm with Yves</p>
                        <p>This slow paced and highly therapeutic style of Yoga is designed to complement a more active and stimulating exercise routine. With the use of long held postures, usually lasting between five and ten minutes per pose, and the carefully guided application of moderate stress on the joints, tendons, and ligaments, Yin Yoga helps to release deep tension in connective tissue structures and works to ease myofascial restrictions such as trigger points or knots, resulting in increased flexibility, range of motion, and circulation. As with all other styles of Yoga, emphasis is placed on mindful breathing techniques and contemplative self inquiry. The unique benefits of Yin Yoga also improve the flow of Qi through the body's meridians increasing vitality, immunity, and overall well-being. </p>
