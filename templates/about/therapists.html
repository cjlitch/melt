            <h4 class="media-heading">Julia Buono, LMT</h4>
            <p>Julia is a New York State Licensed Massage Therapist and Esthetician. Raised in Manhattan and having spent a decade working in the demanding and fast paced TV production industry, Julia has a lot of experience with the constant stresses and high expectations unique to life in our amazing city. She was drawn to massage after noticing the positive physical and psychological effects of consistent bodywork on herself and her family. Trained in both Western and Eastern massage modalities and Reflexology at the Swedish Institute, Julia aims to help your body heal itself using the techniques that will benefit you most on that day. The goal of each session is to increase the activities of the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest mode) and address muscle soreness, joint stiffness, repetitive use injuries, scar tissue build up, and other pathologies. The benefits to you are both medical as well as mental, receiving the soothing and scientifically proven therapeutic effects of human touch. She aspires to help you develop awareness of your own unique body so you know what healthy feels like and can easily recognize and address the early signs of imbalance before they become illness or injury.</p>

            <h4 class="media-heading">Crissy Cretera, LMT</h4>
            <p>Crissy has been practicing massage for as long as she can remember. Her father would have her walk on his back when she was four or five years old and ever since then she has been developing and crafting an intuition she has been happy to embrace. Her education from the Swedish Institute gave her the tools and language necessary for working to alleviate pain and initiate serenity within people. In her five years as a licensed therapist, she has worked in many settings from day spas to chiropractic offices always absorbing new methods and techniques to add to her own cocktail of remedies. Integrating Shiatsu and Swedish in a seamless session, she finds, leaves clients with a feeling of completeness and newness that makes 90 minutes feel like a week of rest. She understands that her client's bodies and minds are changing everyday and every session reflects that. She feels it's her job to find those changes and basically make her clients feel like marshmallows. Healthy, happy marshmallows.</p>

            <h4 class="media-heading">Lauren Drake, LMT</h4>
            <p>Lauren has been studying the body, or at least what it means to live in and use one, her entire life. A constantly inquisitive and embodied individual, she has come to recognize the body for the complex vessel that it is, and more importantly, believes that working with and through the body is a medium with which to understand life most clearly. With an extensive background in dance, yoga, and other movement forms, Lauren brings to her work a refined knowledge of movement patterns and stagnation manifestations, enabling her to locate and alleviate pain and discomfort for her clients. She is trained in Swedish massage and Shiatsu, as well as deep tissue, myofascial, and trigger point techniques and can incorporate all of these modalities into a session, dependent upon clients' needs and preferences. Stylistically, her sessions are slow, yet invigorating, and tend towards fascial release. Lauren views bodywork as a total collaboration, where the therapist provides the space and the encouragement and it is the client's body's wisdom that is doing the true work. She is committed to approaching people and their bodies compassionately, to assisting people's bodies to reveal their truths to them on their own timeline, and to helping people arrive into the destination of their bodies, and <em>love</em> it.</p>

            <h4 class="media-heading">Pamela Joy Pontone, LMT</h4>
            <p>Pamela is a Licensed Massage Therapist living in New York City. She graduated from the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine in NYC, and has worked in 5-star spas and with renowned chiropractors and doctors. She knew that she would do massage since the age of 12, when she met a man who had studied massage under a Shaman in Mexico, and has been enthralled since by the combination of energy work with therapeutic touch. She has been trained in aspects of both Western and Eastern Massage, and enjoys communicating with her clients to help them to understand their muscular tensions from emotional, energetic, as well as Western Medical standpoints. She is highly influenced from her years of practicing yoga, and feels that through the rhythmic control of the breath, clients are better able to release tension. This is because it is through this rhythm that we are able to better harmonize the rhythmic pulsations of our heart, and by attaining peace in our heart, we are able to increase blood circulation and achieve acceptance of all the traumas we have endured. This acceptance helps us to confront and to let go of those traumas and leave the massage feeling lighter and more brisk, and better able to receive the benefits of the massage itself.</p>
